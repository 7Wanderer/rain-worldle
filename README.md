A LOLdle clone, based on the bestiary within the game Rain World by Videocult.

List of issues:

- Dropdown box is not in alphabetical order
- Background doesn't contrast the body enough
- Input box does not reset after typing
- Dropdown box is not centered
- Icons briefly display the previous icon before loading the correct icon
- Developer has gone mental

List of things to add:

- Animations for the boxes (flipping over would be nice)
- Congratulating the user upon completing the game, and displaying their number of guesses
- The 'region' gamemode, where the user guesses the region based on an image of a room.
